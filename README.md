# Relais Photo

This projet renders a simple webpage used for a client.

The goal is to display an input field (input is named the key) and return a value (a code).

Please note that the codes themselves are not considered sensitive data and are to be used arbitrarly somewhere.
Additionally, the client pulls the whole dataset at page load and could theorically have access to all codes, but this is a limitation that this projet can tolerate.
